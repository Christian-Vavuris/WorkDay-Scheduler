## Description
The scheduler is intended to serve as a calendar for a given day. 

Unfortunately I was unable to give as much time as I wanted to this project, and that is why it is in an unfinished state.  I will do better next week with the challenge. 

## Requirements
Working on this site requires a beginner's understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No other languages are required. Basic terminal navigation and git knowledge a plus.

## Project Notes
Website is optimized for Google Chrome. Most recent work on this page was adding JavaScript to dynamically provide the prompts and display the password.

Dev Notes
All files should be found in the WorkDay-Scheduler repository

All refactoring performed by Chris Vavuris via Berkeley Boot Camp!
